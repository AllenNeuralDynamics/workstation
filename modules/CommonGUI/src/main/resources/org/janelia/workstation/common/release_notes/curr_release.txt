Data Browser
* Core browser functionality was refactored into multiple modules for better maintainability and extensibility.
* The Workstation client is now able to connect to different backend servers (File->Connect)
* You can show create and manage user groups using the Administration Tool (Window->Core)
* Improved dependency management, application installers and distribution.
* Many performance improvements and bug fixes

MouseLight Tools
* Both Horta and LVV were modified to pull data from the JADE storage service, eliminating the previous
  dependency on internal Samba drive mounts. It is no longer necessary to mount external drives to use these tools.

Horta
* Import/export color model dialogs default to standard folder on shared drive
