Horta
* Fixed issue with hidden neurons reappearing
* Added "Show other neurons" feature to neuron right-click menu and neuron gear menu
* Fixed issue with right-clicking in 3d view giving error in second workspace opened
* Large numbers of SWC files may now be loaded from zip files directly; this is especially important in the HortaCloud environment, as S3 file system overhead makes loading large numbers of individual SWC files glacially slow
