Horta
* Neuron persistence was refactored to be more reliable
* Added "problem end" shortcut action; don't allow traced/problem end on non-ends
* Do not allow users to create a neuron in a workspace in which they do not have write permissions
* Fixed issue with hidden neurons reappearing
* Added "Show other neurons" feature to neuron right-click menu and neuron gear menu
* Fixed issue with right-clicking in 3d view giving error in second workspace opened
* Optimized HTTP client instantiation

HortaCloud
* Fixed email error reporting so that it works in HortaCloud
* Option to start a workstation instance that does not expose the Login dialog
* Large numbers of SWC files may now be loaded from zip files directly; this is especially important in the HortaCloud environment, as S3 file system overhead makes loading large numbers of individual SWC files glacially slow
