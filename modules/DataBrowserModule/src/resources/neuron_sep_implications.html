<b>Are you sure you want to delete the [%s] stacks from sample %s and remove it from reprocessing?</b>
<br/>
This will cause removal of:
<ul>
    <li>
        Neuron Separation files
    </li>
</ul>
MIPs and Movies will be kept, but with limited access and will not be regenerated with
 new algorithms when the sample is reprocessed.
<br>
Original LSMs will always be kept.
