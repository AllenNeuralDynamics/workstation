// 6.0-RC2

This is a Release Candidate for the 6.0 release.

In this major release, the Janelia Workstation has been updated to use the latest Java and NetBeans platform 
libraries. As a consequence, it now requires Java 8 to run. 

In addition, the Look and Feel has been completely replaced in order to address rendering issues on MacOS Sierra.
