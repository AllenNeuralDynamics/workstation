* The "Add Related Items to Folder" option now allows mapping from unaligned neuron fragments 
  to aligned neuron fragments and vice versa.
* "Change Sample Compression Strategy" now supports visually lossless neuron separations. 
  All neuron separations are currently lossless. Converting them to visually lossless format can 
  reduce disk space usage by up to 70%. 
* Added "Open Neuron Separation (Lossy)" option, which can be used to simulate a lossy neuron 
  separation before changing compression strategy. 
* Fixed two memory leaks when opening many dialog boxes
* Other minor bug fixes
