// 6.0-RC1

This is the first Release Candidate for the 6.0 release.

In this major release, the Janelia Workstation has been updated to use the latest Java and NetBeans platform 
libraries. As a consequence, it now requires Java 8 to run. 

In addition, the Look and Feel has been completely replaced in order to address rendering issues on MacOS Sierra.

Workstation Browser
* Each tab now maintains its own Back/Forward history 
* You can now navigate backwards to unsaved filters using the Back button
* LSM attributes (like "Objective" and "Num Channels") can be specified in file names when using the Download Wizard 
* Removed "Pattern Annotation Search" and "Giant Fiber Mask Search" features
* Fixed issue with creating annotations from within Neuron Annotator
* Support for opening unseparated results and visually lossless separations in Neuron Annotator. Note that this update
  implements this feature on the Workstation side. The required update to NA will be made available separately.
