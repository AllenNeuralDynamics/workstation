// 6.0

In this major release, the Janelia Workstation has been updated to use the latest Java and NetBeans platform 
libraries. As a consequence, it now requires Java 8 and a clean reinstall. In addition, the Look and Feel 
has been completely replaced in order to address rendering issues on MacOS Sierra.

Other improvements:

Data Browser
* Added the "Start Page" for quickly creating basic filters and viewing data statistics
* Improved the user interface for the login dialog
* Improved performance of removal of items from folders

Large Volume Viewer
* Fixed bug: lines drawn properly after importing multiple swc files
* Added "set radius for neuron" feature in LVV
