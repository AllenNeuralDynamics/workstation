// 6.0-RC1

This is the first Release Candidate for the 6.0 release.

In this major release, the Janelia Workstation has been updated to use the latest Java and NetBeans platform 
libraries. As a consequence, it now requires Java 8 to run. 

In addition, the Look and Feel has been completely replaced in order to address rendering issues on MacOS Sierra.
