Removal of the "whole anatomical area" includes removal of the stitched file, and will prevent future creation of:
<ul>
    <li>The stitched image file (lossless or visually lossless).</li>
    <li>MIPS or Movies based on the stitched file.</li>
    <li>Any 'alignment' artifacts, including:</li>
    <li>The alignment verification movie.</li>
    <li>Any 'Neuron Separation' artifacts, including:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The .nsp files.</li>
        <li>Fast Stack file from neuron separation (mp4)</li>
        <li>Neuron png files.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Any neuron-based artifacts used in an Alignment Board:</li>
    <ul><li>Reference image.</li>
        <li>Neuron Fragments.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
In addition, the "whole anatomical area" images as follows will no longer exist:
<ur>
    <li>'Lossless' or 'Visually Lossless' stack.</li>
    <li>Signal MIP file.</li>
    <li>Reference MIP file.</li>
</ur>
