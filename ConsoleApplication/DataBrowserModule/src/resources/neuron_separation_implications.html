<b>Are you sure you want to delete the &quot;neuron separations&quot; of [%s] for sample %s and remove it from reprocessing?</b>
<br/>
This will cause removal of:
<ul>
    <li>
The "Fast Stack", or the file viewed in 3D in Light Box
    </li>
    <li>
Neuron Separation files
    </li>
    <li>
Alignment Board files
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
Original LSMs will always be kept.
